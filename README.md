# Benchmarking Rubies

Rubybench is to benchmarking what rubyspec is to testing. In other words, this 
project aims at setting up a collection of useful benchmarks of available ruby 
implementations. **The aim is not to compare them**, but rather to provide sound, 
peer reviewed benchmarks to help identifying and removing current bottlenecks.
